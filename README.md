# Linked list & Doubly linked list & MongoDB

Initial code inspired by [Joe Karlsson](https://twitter.com/JoeKarlsson1)'s youtube video [@MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK_m2976Yvbx-TyDLw7n1WA) youtube channel - [Intro to Linked Lists with MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCMx5SkhNVE).

I decided to build upon the code written in the video and create a Doubly Linked List DS as a basis to implementing a functionality within my hobby project.
The initial code is a direct copy of the code written in the video, except for the db connection string, db name and collection name being extracted into a *.env* file as a security measure.
